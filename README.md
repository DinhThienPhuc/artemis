# ARTEMIS

## `atm` commands

`atm` is a library contains a lot of commands like npm and some additional commands to easily work on an Artemis project.
First, you need to install `atm` as a global package

```bash
npm i -g .\scripts\atm\ --force
```

Then you can use npm-like command, using `atm` commands at the root of the project

```bash
# Add package into app/lib
atm add --app=<app-name> <list-of-packages> <option-like-npm>

atm add --lib=<lib-name> <list-of-packages> <option-like-npm>

# Example:
atm add --app=reacts eslint prettier husky --save-dev
```

```bash
# Remove package from app/lib
atm remove --app=<app-name> <list-of-packages>

atm remove --lib=<lib-name> <list-of-packages>

# Example:
atm remove --lib=utils react next
```

```bash
# Delete filde/folder package from app/lib
atm delete --app=<app-name> <list-of-files-and-folders>

atm delete --lib=<lib-name> <list-of-files-and-folders>

# Example:
atm delete --app=reacts package-lock.json node_modules
```

To apply those new commands on the root of the project, just omit the `--app` option

```bash
atm add <list-of-files-and-folders>

# Example:
atm add typescript
```
